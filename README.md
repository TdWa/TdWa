<h3 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting my profile! </br>
I'm Tim - a passionate junior developer based in The Netherlands </h3>

 Since 2020 I decided to follow my passion for computer technology and start a coding career. 
I had just finished a master in Law and Technology, but during these studies I'd gradually discovered that I have a lot more interest in the tech itself than in arguing about it as a lawyer ;)
Now I'm coding and learning things every day and really enjoy each new project.

I'm about to graduate from the [Codaisseur Academy](https://codaisseur.com/courses/academy/) in Amsterdam, where I've been following an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp for the past three months. 
I'm now looking for an opportunity to work as a junior developer, to apply the skills that I've learned, work on cool stuff, have fun and develop myself further as a programmer.

### My latest project:

My latest project is a full-stack web app to demonstrate the main skills I've learned in the Codaisseur Academy. It's made in a two-week sprint in which I developed the idea, planned the wireframes and datamodels, built the frontend with TypeScript, React & Redux and the backend with an Express server and PostgreSQL database.

I made a platform called "Make a Scene" where you can create and discuss scripted conversations, and turn them into an animated scene. You can check out the website [here](https://make-a-scene.netlify.app/), or take a look at the [README](https://github.com/TdWa/make-a-scene-frontend) in the frontend repository!
